### Goals and Objectives

- Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
- Work with an API to send and receive data
- Solidify the code review process
- Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

### Local setup

- `git clone` the repo to your local machine
- run `npm install` to download all necessary dependencies
- run `npm start` to run the server
- open `localhost:8080` (unless your terminal says otherwise)
- use `customer1` (or any other number from 1 to 50, a number is an id of user) as username and `overlook2021` as a password to go to manager board

### Tech Stack

- HTML, CSS
- JS
- Chai & Mocha
- Webpack
- Fetch API for receiving 3rd party data


### Wins

- Having a project board to manage workload
- Independently building the whole app with client-server interactions
- Completing all functionality for customer and login

### Challenges

- Making GET, POST requests
- Adding login functionality with credential validation
- Covering all possible errors to make them visible for users
- Creating connections between different classes and defining functionality for each of them
